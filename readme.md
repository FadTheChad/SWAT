# SWAT

This is SWAT, a moderation and automoderation bot for Discord. Made for all types of server setups and made to give moderators plenty of choice when handling different moderation scenarios.

Version is currently **__0 Dev__**. This means that the core functionality of the bot is still largely untested and under developed, there's a high probability that the bot will break.
To keep updated with the bot and it's development, join the [Support Server](#support).

## Contributing
I'm more than happy to let anyone add almost anything to the bot, providing it's within the scope of the project.
Start an issue, submit a PR and I'll get to it when I can :)

Here's a high level guide on how to spin up a development version of the bot:
- `yarn`
- **Follow the [.example.env](https://github.com/Codeize/SWAT/blob/main/.env.example) file and fill it out.**
- `yarn build`
