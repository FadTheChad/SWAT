# SWAT

This is SWAT, a moderation and automoderation bot for Discord. Made for all types of server setups and made to give moderators plenty of choice when handling different moderation scenarios.

Version is currently **__0 Dev__**. This means that the core functionality of the bot is still largely untested and under developed, there's a high probability that the bot will break.
To keep updated with the bot and it's development, join the [Support Server](#support).
